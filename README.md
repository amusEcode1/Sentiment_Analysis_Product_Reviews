## ðŸ›’ Product Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Title
Product Review â€“ AI-Powered Sentiment Classification

## Description
This project is a Machine Learning and NLP-powered web application that classifies product reviews as Positive or Negative.
It uses advanced text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and Scikit-learn classifiers (such as Logistic Regression and NaÃ¯ve Bayes) to analyze sentiment in real time.<br>
The app is deployed with Streamlit, allowing users to input product reviews directly and instantly view the predicted sentiment.
This serves as a hands-on example of integrating machine learning pipelines into an interactive web app.
